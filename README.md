## 📚 Overview
Quick order of running for now
1. Install any relevant packages (there is no requirements file yet)
2. Run preprocessing and preprocessing test data, this will create the data CSVs
3. Run the models file, this will generate output in txt files that show the results for the models under all hyperparam combinations. There is also a file that shows the best models
4. There is a file for exploration of the results per model (so three in total) these create the plots in the thesis.
